		I receive numerous inquiries about joining our lab. Unfortunately, I am unable to accommodate all requests. I do not reply to clearly generic emails; however, I make every effort to respond to emails that explain how you aim to contribute to our research through
			(i) creative thinking that could open new research directions, 
			(ii) strong technical skills to tackle ongoing project challenges, and/or 
			(iii) the ability to translate research ideas into impactful real-world implementations.

<h2>Inside ONE Lab - Q&A</h2>
<table width="700" border="0" align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td width="100%" valign="middle">
<ul>
	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>What’s the lab culture and organizational structure of ONE lab?</strong></li>
		The lab has an open and collaborative culture. Each member leads at least one research project and serves as the first author on the resulting publications.<br>

		Lab members are encouraged to work together, and current research projects are listed on the lab’s Notion page so you can see what everyone is working on.<br>

		Leading your own project is the most effective way to learn to conduct research.<br>

		Typically, a student develops their own line of work while also contributing to one or two projects led by others.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>If I am leading a research project, what guidance will I have from the PI?</strong></li>
		You will have direct guidance and mentorship from the PI. One-on-one meetings are dedicated to discussing your lead research project, professional development, and any personal topics you’d like to discuss. Typically, we schedule a 30-minute one-on-one meeting each week; additional appointments or walk-ins are also welcome.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Other than one-on-one meetings, does the ONE Lab have group meetings?</strong></li>
		Yes. As a project lead, you can run your own project meetings with your collaborators. In addition, we hold regular group meetings for paper reading, research updates, and conference presentation rehearsals when needed. Typically, we have a scheduled one-hour group meeting each week in one of these formats. If more is happening in a given week, we may add an informal coffee-chat–style meeting, with coffee or snacks for everyone.

	
	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Will I be assigned a project to lead by the PI, or can I choose my own?</strong></li>
		You are encouraged to develop and propose your own research ideas. For junior students, I may constrain the project scope slightly to enable them to focus on developing core research skills. Some projects are funded through specific grants, and if you are supported as an RA, you may be expected to work on those funded projects. I will discuss this with you in advance if we plan to place you on a grant-supported project.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>What other constraints come with RA funding?</strong></li>
		If you are funded as an RA through a specific grant, your research will typically focus on topics aligned with the grant’s objectives, and your publications will be expected to fall within that scope. Occasionally, you may also be asked to assist with grant-related progress reports and presentations.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>If I run out of RA funding or a grant is cut (which can happen these days), how is that handled?</strong></li>
		In general, it is the advisor’s responsibility. If a grant ends, I will place you on another available grant, subject to mutual agreement. You may also work with me to write new grant proposals in your areas of interest or seek external scholarships; we have students supported through scholarships. As a fallback, the department can also cover students through TA positions.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Is there a TA requirement in the program?</strong></li>
		No, there is no TA requirement. However, I strongly recommend serving as a TA for at least one semester during your graduate studies. Teaching is an excellent way to deepen and consolidate your understanding of core concepts.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>If I publish my work at a conference, will I be supported?</strong></li>
		Yes, I support all students in my lab in attending conferences to present their research.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>What’s the roadmap or milestones for PhD students in the ONE Lab?</strong></li>
		While each student’s path is unique, there are general milestones that I follow, which are available here: <a target="_blank" href="https://grad.unm.edu/resources/graduate-students/start-to-finish-unm/phd/phd-roadmap.html">https://grad.unm.edu/resources/graduate-students/start-to-finish-unm/phd/phd-roadmap.html</a>. Based on these guidelines, I will share a private Notion page with each student that includes a personalized written plan and milestones to track progress.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Will I be working in a common lab space or have an office?</strong></li>
		You will be provided with a workspace in our lab. In addition, you will have access to an office space, typically shared with one or two other students, which may include students outside our lab.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>What your expectation do you have for your students?</strong></li>
		In general, I expect you to enjoy the process and fun of doing research. I also expect to work with you on cutting-edge research in your areas of interest with passion, curiosity, and dedication.


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Other specific expectations (time, vacation, papers, projects, research, etc.)</strong></li>
		Time: <i>You have the freedom to work whenever you want, as long as you make steady progress on your research</i>.<br>

		Location: <i>You have the freedom to work wherever you are most productive. However, I am often on campus during the day, so being on-site can make quick discussions easier; this also applies to discussions with collaborators.</i><br>

		Vacation: <i>You have flexibility in taking vacations; just let me know in advance when you plan to be away.</i><br>

		Papers: <i>I expect you to set internal deadlines ahead of official submission dates, with extra buffer time when working with external collaborators.</i><br>

		Projects: <i>I expect you to stay on top of the projects you lead and to communicate effectively with all collaborators.</i><br>

		Research: <i>I expect you to be highly motivated and to take ownership of your work.</i>


	<li style="font-size:16px; color:#5869BB"><strong>Are there any lab events?</strong></li>
		Yes. We organize lab social activities, and family members and significant others are welcome to join. These events usually occur twice per semester, at the beginning and end. We may also hold joint social events with other research groups.
